# FoxMusicPlayer

I created my first desktop application in c# and .net framework. this was my first experience building a desktop app from start to finish. 
When I created this application, I relied on documentation windows and some pages on Stack Overflow. This app is its beta test. 
This app does not have many of the features that I want. I am creating a lot of updates for this application.
